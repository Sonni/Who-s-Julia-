Notes:

Okay, but the problemstatement are not importent but we can use it in the presentation. We should show them what we are doing. Julia, Explain benchmarking, performance. 

Computer specifications(Cores, heavy duty, etc.). Test on different computers, maybe compare AMD and Intel. Use virtual machine. OS and versions of programming language. Test RAM limits and Swapping. 

Do not expect strong evidence and strong conclusions. 

Time data does not seem right. Parting the code in File reading, iteration, sorting, etc.

Change graph. Boxplot. compare runningtimes

Graphtheory. Find closure of relation.

Keep the Abstract simple. What we are going to do. we do this, this, this, this, this..
