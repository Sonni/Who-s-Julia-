Notes from midway seminar and short talk with Michal.

Seminar went okay, good powerpoint. We could had been better prepared.
Make sure everything is readable on slides, if there's too much lighting,
or a bad projector.
Animations on slides(how does a algorithm work) - especially when explaining
a problem/algorithm.
Show more code of Julia vs. Python, like loops, functions, initialize arrays.
Explain projecteuler.
Explain benchmarking the first it is mentioned.
Explain: Real-time = walltime etc.
Show how you actually measure time: in terminal: time julia name_of_program

Either do many problems on projecteuler, or go deep into the design of
the language, to explain why there's a difference between the running time
of languages.

Consider Javascript

Go really deep in to the design and learning of Julia.
What's is the difference in design compared to python?
There must be some differences since there's a gap in the running
time of these languages.
Examine object oriented programming in Julia.


Suggestions from seminar:
- Optimize an algorithm in each specific language
- Ruby - could be really fast on small/short algorithms.
- Profiling in c#: ANTS Performance Profile
- VM to run Java
- Try code on different systems
