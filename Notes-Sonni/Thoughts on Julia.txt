Things i DON’T like about Julia:

no way to increment and decrement ++ —-

Syntax (brackets) (you have to use end every time)

for loops (i=0;-1;limit  instead of   i=0;limit;-1)

Documentation is somewhat bad

Lag of stackoverflow ect.




Things i LIKE about Julia:

Easy to learn

flexible (especially matrices)
