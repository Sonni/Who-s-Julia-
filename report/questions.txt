What do we do about python?
It is really slow compared to other languages.
We have tried to read about how to optimize, but haven't gotten anywhere.
E.g. for 2d arrays in python we have read that using NumPy would deffinately
make better run time, but this is an extension to python.
Should we try it?
We think we shouldn't since it requires to install an external package.

On many euler problems we have found algorithms found on the inthernet, should this be referenced?

We can only make the running time for quicksort with dual pivot about 2 min.
Larger dataset will cause cause of out memory error.
We've tried to parse the data to Javas sort function, the same error occurs.
